# vrep-plugin-skeleton-cmake
Vrep plugin skeleton with CMake. Vrep is shipped with a skeleton for plugins that uses makefile for compilation. This is the same thing (same code, same dependencies, etc) but with a CMakeLists.txt.
All the code except the cmake file is created and licensed by [Coppelia Robotics](www.coppeliarobotics.com).
